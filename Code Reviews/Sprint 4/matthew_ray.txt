AudioManager.cs
Joe Distler
The AudioManager builds on the Media Player built into xna.  Our AudioManager has all the needed sounds effects as well as 2 theme song options.  The sounds effects
play just once while the use of Media Player's isRepeating boolean allows for the theme song to loop.

The main change I would like to add is the ability to stop the theme music without muting the whole AudioManager.  This would allow for the sound effects of a game over
screen or a menu screen to be played, while stopping the theme music.  Currently you can either mute the whole thing, but this blocks the sound effects from playing.
I think this change would be fairly simple to implement given more time.  Some function that is able to call MediaPlayer.Stop() (like in line 79-81) without a follow up
call to Play()
