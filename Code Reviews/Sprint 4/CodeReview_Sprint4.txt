The HUD object is a clean implementation that handles all of the player feedback.
The HUD is easy to control and one can update the feedback from anywhere needed. It can be easily
modified to handle more player feedback if needed.

Minutes taken: 10 mins

Hypothetical Change: A hypothetical change to the HUD would be to allow for other objects appear
on the screen such as sprites. The current implementation only handles font. To implement sprites would be easy by 
passing the HUD a graphics device to handle sprites to the screen.
