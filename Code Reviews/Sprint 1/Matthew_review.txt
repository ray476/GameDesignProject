Overall I like this code, it is definitely  an improvement from the sprint 0 sprites.
One thing I like about this code is the nice use of many private fields, with select public properties
Another thing I like about this code is how much more straighforward/easy (due to fewer parameters
in a more logical order) to use the constructors are compared to the old Sprite classes.

One change I would consider is removing the Teleport(int xDisp, int yDis) method.  My 
reasoning behind this is that position is already a public property with a get and set method.  Is 
it not redundant to have a method which sets the position, when you could just directly set
the new desired position.  If we wish to implement this change it would be rather easy as the 
method only shows 5 references, (ISprite, SpriteAnimated, SpriteStatic, BlockObject, MarioObject)
which are only in classes implementing ISprite.
