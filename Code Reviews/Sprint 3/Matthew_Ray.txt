GameStateManager.cs GameState.cs PlayGameState.cs
Stephen Radvansky
These files were added to allow for the game to be reset.  They mirror much of the Game1 class, effectively replacing and reducing Game1 to a holder of the 
PlayGameState.  GameStateManager holds all the GameStates and acts like a mix of an Stack, with add and remove methods, and a Game, with update and draw methods.

The change I would propose would be to make GameState extend the Game class instead.  This way Game1 (which is already nearly empty) could just be removed.
While this might not make much of a performance benefit, it would remove the number of classes in our solution by one.  I believe our code could handle this change farily easily.
First, Progam would need a quick change in line 17.  Then the remaining code in Game1's methods would need to be added to PlayGameState's corresponding methods.
