Camera.cs Layer.cs

Camera - This code is clean, easy to read and relatively straightforward. There are no long if else chains or hastily named variables, and the 
code will not need much if any updating as we progress. There are some clever shorcuts here like with Rectangle? to check for null.
Each function performs a specific task that is easily defined  which is another plus. Most importantly, this code works.
With all of our issues implementing collision detection it is nice to have some code that performs its desired function.

Layer - Like with the camera, layer is some nice looking code. No clutter here and should not need major updates. Its nice that we can continue
adding layers each with their own parallaxing. Again this code works which is a breath of fresh air. 

I think a cool potential change would be to have the camera move ahead of mario when he is moving forward. This is a common feature in games
because as the player is moving forward it is better to have the majority of the screen ahead of him since he is not too concerned with things behind him.
Then as the player comes to a rest the camera will come back to center on him. It would not be too difficult to implement this with the current code, but
seeing as we still have a heavy backlog, I don't see this happening anytime soon.
