Tokenizer.cs

Overall, the tokenizer works fine. One change I would suggest is to allow for the blocks to be able to hold
multiple ItemObjects of the same type for all item types, not just coins. Even though blocks that hold anything
other than coins only hold one item in the original games, we should not be limiting ourselves to just being 
able to do that. This opens more opportunities for possible features that could be added in the future.
A similar suggestion would be to allow blocks to hold hidden enemies, which could allow for more interesting
possibilities in features to add in the future.
